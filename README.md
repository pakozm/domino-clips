# Domino game in CLIPS

This game has been developed as a project of artificial intelligence course
during our computer science degree in 2003-2004 academic year for Knowledge
Engineering course.

Contains source code of [CLIPS](http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/) plus some
extensions to allow input/output interactions using
[SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library.

It has been updated to work with CLIPS 6.30.

## Instructions

```
$ cd src
$ make
$ ./domino
```
